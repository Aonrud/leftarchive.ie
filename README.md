Repository for the Irish Left Archive website at [leftarchive.ie](https://www.leftarchive.ie).

The website is built with [Symphony CMS](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphonycms), which provides the content data in XML for presentation by the XSLT frontend in the `workspace` directory. Although Symphony CMS is no longer under development, it is made public here for interested readers.
