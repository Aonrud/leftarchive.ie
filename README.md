# ILA Symphony CMS workspace

This is the frontend for the Irish Left Archive website, working on [Symphony CMS](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphonycms).

While there's a lot of legacy code, and XSLT isn't the most contemporary approach to frontends (!), it's made available here for any curious users. Because the repository previously contained private information, it has been added without the commit history dating to the start of the project in 2013.

You can visit the [Irish Left Archive at leftarchive.ie](https://www.leftarchive.ie).

The CMS, extensions used and Docker setup for the site are contained in the [leftarchive.ie repository](https://github.com/Aonrud/leftarchive.ie).
